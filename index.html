      <h1>Game Engines</h1>
      <p>
        Developing a <strong>video game</strong> is often a process massively
        unique to the type of game you are creating. However, most if not all
        games share important building blocks, such as
        <strong>graphics</strong> and <strong>physics</strong>, that can be
        abtracted into its own module and applied to a wide variety of games.
        This abstraction is called a <strong>game engine</strong>, and some
        popular examples freely available to independent developers and studios
        are <strong>Unreal Engine, Unity</strong>, and
